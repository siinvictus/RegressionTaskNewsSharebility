# RegressionTaskNewsSharebility
The aim of this report is to provide an approach to  building a regression pipeline to predict the shareability of news  in a given dataset. In particular, we perform an extensive analysis  of all the possible steps to follow in the design of the regression  model. We explore a wide variety of models  and preprocessing techniques.
